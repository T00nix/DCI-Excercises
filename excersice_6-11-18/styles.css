/* Absolute positioning becomes much more practical when itâ€™s relative to some other element that is in the static flow of the page.
The [.absolute div] is laid out with the normal flow of the page, and we can manually move around our [.item-absolute] wherever we need to. This is great, because if we want to alter the normal flow of the container, say, for a mobile layout, any absolutely positioned elements will automatically move with it. */
